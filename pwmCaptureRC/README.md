# TRIK RC with PWM capture

This script and corresponding `model-config.xml` were tested with FlySky GT2B FS-GR3C FS-GT2B.

The receiver must be connected in the following way:
* Channel 1 (steering wheel) is connected to S3;
* Channel 2 (trigger) is connected to S2;
* Channel 3 (side button) is connected to S1.

Trigger controls the throttle, the steering wheel used for turning, and the side button controls movement direction (default, forward).
